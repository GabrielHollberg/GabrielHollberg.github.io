            Well, it's been what? 4 days since I last wrote? And guess what?
            I actually finished that Software Engineering class I mentioned
            last time!<br><br>
            That's fairly impressive, it sometimes takes me a long time before I get
            to things. Anyway, I guess writing it down was actually super helpful.
            I believe that we have the potential to accomplish so much. The key 
            is wanting to do it.<br><br>
            I mean think about it. How much are you willing to do to get something
            you really want? And I don't mean that in a weak form of want, but a 
            strong true form of want. What you truly want you get. We just sometimes
            believe we want things that we don't actually want. If you truly want
            something you will do anything for it. Anything. If you truly want
            money you will work hard enough to earn it and if that doesn't work
            you will steal from others. If you aren't willing to do either of these
            things you must want something else and not truly want money. What you
            really want might be to relax rather than to work hard or to not hurt
            others instead of stealing from them.<br><br>
            You always get what you truly want, you just sometimes want weakly
            against your own true strong wants.<br><br>
            "Ask and ye shall recieve"<br><br>
            I'm putting my focuses in an honest order, but I may need to work on
            changing that order.<br><br>
            Focus #1<br><br>
            Quality Assurance Class<br><br>
            Focus #2<br><br>
            Go to the Temple<br><br>
            Focus #3<br><br>
            Workout<br><br>
