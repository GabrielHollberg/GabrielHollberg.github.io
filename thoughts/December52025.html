            Just sitting here at the same old stop again listening to Vance Joy.
            Scratch that, It's actually Stubborn Love by The Illumineers.<br><br>
            Anyway, I've got a few minutes before I can scan one of the packages
            at this stop so here I am at the keyboard again. This is good practice
            anyway though since I learned to type in Dvorak recently and I'm working
            on getting better at it. It really is holding me back a little at this
            point since I can only type like 30 words per minute, but I am getting
            better and I'll keep you updated with my speed. It's actually pretty
            funny cause I struggle to type normally now, but I don't know, maybe
            if I tested my normal typing speed it would still be better. Mostly
            at this point I've just messed up my regular typing to learn Dvorak,
            but I think it'll be cool when I'm typing faster in Dvorak than I was
            normally anyway.<br><br>
            Anyway, my time is pretty much up at this point. Maybe I'll just type
            out some of my desired focuses real quick. And at some point I'll type about my
            opinion of having focuses instead of goals.<br><br>
            Focus #1<br><br>
            Finish WGU Software Engineering class<br><br>
            Focus #2<br><br>
            Finish another WGU class<br><br>
            Focus #3<br><br>
            Workout everyday<br><br>
            Focus #4<br><br>
            Go to the temple weekly<br><br>
            By the way these aren't necessarily things I am doing perfectly they are
            the things I would like to be doing perfectly. And how better to start
            then by writing them down right?
